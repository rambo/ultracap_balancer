Series ultracap balancer
========================

Circuits to monitor and balance multiple ultracaps connected to a series.

## 6-Way balancer

[6way.sch](./6way.sch): for 6 Maxel 2600F 2.5V boostcaps in series, balanced
by discharging each cap through 1Ohm resistor as needed.

IMCOMPLETE DESIGN, DO NOT USE.

## FAN7385 & DMG9926 breakout

[fan7385_breakout.sch](./fan7385_breakout.sch): Breaks out both chips to 100mil 
pin headers, the parts can be separated by cutting the board, has the likely connections
either pre-made or available via solder jumpers.
